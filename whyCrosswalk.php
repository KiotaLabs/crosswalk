									<h4>Why Crosswalk?</h4>
									<p>It is time for something better, something easier, something smarter and something trustier.</p>
									
									
									<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. TEXTBOOKS </b></p>
									<p>Designed for today’s students, the textbooks have an innovative, high-impact writing style that explains topics clearly and concisely. The author has used a variety of pedagogical tools to ensure that the learning is smooth. The author has used direct sentences and step-by-step calculations in order to provide an easy-to-follow structure to the students, without comprising content or rigor.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> a.	Complete and Current</b><br>The content in the textbooks is self-contained and sufficient to address effectively the learning targets of the curriculum. The content is not only current but also relevant and accurate. The core elements of the subject curriculum are included. We have ensured that no superfluous information is covered. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>b.	Example and Illustrations</b><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are adequate examples and illustrations that are not only interesting but also relevant to students’ experience. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>c.	Difficulty Level</b><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The level of difficulty of the content is consistent with the examination requirements. An appropriate balance is maintained between depth and breadth in the treatment of the subject content.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>d.	Layout</b><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The layout of the content is consistent and student friendly. The book uses large font sizes and reader friendly color schemes for better grasp and retention. In our textbooks, all the examples, illustrations and mnemonics are clearly identified for easy reference. All the in-text examples are in blue and illustrative exhibits are presented with an orange background. Illustrative journal entries and formula are presented in pink for quick revision and easy reference.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>e.	Appropriate Structure</b><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An appropriate structure of the content is provided to students to ensure quick and smooth learning. The content sequence is not only appropriate and but also logical. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>f.	Mnemonics </b><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The content explains concepts using mnemonics that not only facilitate easy recall but also make sense.</p>
									
									<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. VIDEO LECTURES </b></p>
									<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>a. Subtitles</b><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our video lectures offers subtitles. The use of subtitles on videos makes the content easily digestible and improves your engagement level. Therefore, even if you do not have a very good understanding of the language it is taught in (that is, English), you can still make the most out of this course.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>b.	Trivia</b><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Did You Know?” Trivia are included in videos to give insight on the subject matter. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>c.	Summaries</b><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each video ends with a summary of the key points for the chapter. These summaries provide students with a quick review of the important topics and issues discussed in the video.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>d.	Animations</b><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our videos use animations. Various difficult concepts have been depicted with short animations. Animations are a great way to facilitate understanding and have the potential to deliver content with a greater efficiency. </P>
									
									<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL </b></p>
									<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The review program includes supplementary material that ties directly to the textbook content. The supplementary material helps identify key concepts and provides students with a quick review of the important issues. </P>
								
									<p style="text-transform:uppercase"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Audio Lectures (Anywhere-Anytime Learning)</b></p>
									<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that you don’t never have enough time. So, we provide audio lectures in our course so that you are able to access the content anytime and anywhere. It is much more comfortable to listen to an audio lecture than read a textbook. The audio lectures provide you an alternative to text and a study aid that you can review after lecture. Audio lectures help you review large content in a short period of time. These audio lectures provide you with an occasional break from reading (and rereading the same concepts again and again) and a different way in which you can understand and grasp concepts.</p>
								
									<p style="text-transform:uppercase"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;5.	Printed Flash Cards</b></p>
									<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We provide professionally produced flashcards (printed and online) that allow you to quickly revisit information and test your understanding. Using flashcards is considered more effective than reading a textbook and is particularly useful for recognizing the concept on a multiple-choice question.  Each time you practice a flashcard, you force your brain to remember a concept. This helps burn information into the brain as you make effort to recall a concept. The cards facilitate quick comparison when you reveal the answer side of a flashcard to access the accuracy of your response. Flash cards are a handy resource to have and are useful at every stage of your preparation for the CPA Exam. <b>We also provide a set of blank flashcards that you may use for creating your own flashcards.</b></p>
								
									<p style="text-transform:uppercase"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;6.	Online Student Support</b></p>
									<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We provide online support to our students on any issue pertaining to the content. Our instructors and query solving team include senior educators from academia and the industry.</p>
								
									<p style="text-transform:uppercase"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;7.	Printed Question Bank</b></p>
									<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We provide a large number of multiple-choice questions (both printed and online) that our students may practice. Our question bank includes questions released by AICPA.</p>
								
									<p style="text-transform:uppercase"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;8.	Licensing Assistance</b></p>
									<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After passing the CPA Examination, the candidate may apply for a license to practice public accounting. We guide our students in obtaining the CPA license.</p>
