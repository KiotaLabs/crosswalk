									<h4>Eligibility Requirements</h4>
									<p>In order to sit for the Uniform CPA Exam, a candidate must meet the eligibility requirements of any one of the 55 states or jurisdictions of the United States. Each state sets its own educational requirements. However, most state boards require a minimum of 150 hours of post-secondary education from a regionally accredited institution and specify a minimum number of college credits in various accounting topics and business law. To obtain 150 hours of post-secondary education, generally a master’s degree in accounting or taxation is suffice. Although, a master’s degree is advised but is not an essential requirement. A candidate may meet the requirement by taking additional courses without a master’s degree. The exact requirements vary from state to state and you may contact our Eligibility Team (info@crosswalkcpa.com) for insight on this. 
									<br><br><br>Please read the Candidate Bulletin or click the link below to determine the specific state eligibility requirements. </p>

									<h4>International Education Evaluation</h4>
									<p>Candidates who received their education from a college or university outside the United States, they must have their transcripts evaluated by a recognized evaluation service to determine whether they meet the eligibility requirements of the state for which they are applying.
									<br><br><br>You may click on the link below to get specific information on each state’s eligibility requirements.</p>

									<h4>Applying for the Exam</h4> 
									<p>The CPA Exam application process involves submitting the application form along with transcripts and fees, to the state board or its designated agent. Candidates should refer the latest application requirement set by the state for which they are applying.
									<br><br><br>Note: The name on the application matches exactly the name on identification the candidate plans to take to the testing center.
									</p>

									<h4>Notice to Schedule</h4>
<p>Once the application has been approved and all fees have been all fees, a Notice to Schedule (NTS) from NASBA is sent to the candidate. One NTS is received by the candidate, he or she can schedule the CPA Exam.
<br><br><br>Note: The candidate should ensure that the name on the NTS appears exactly the same as it appears on the identification documents that he or she will use for admission at the testing center and verify that other information appearing on the NTS is correct.</p>									

<h4>Schedule the Exam</h4>
<p>Before beginning the scheduling process, a candidate must check where he or she is eligible to take the Exam. Indian applicants can take the Exam in the following countries.
<br>-	U.S.
<br>-	U.A.E
<br>-	Bahrain
<br>-	Kuwait

<br><br>
